- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
- **Core Charts:** Utilized **Column,Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
- **Geospatial Analytics:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visulize the global distribution of jobs.
- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to provide granular, sortable data.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intutive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
  - **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
  - **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
